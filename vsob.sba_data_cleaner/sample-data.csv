The quality and design of our products are second to none and all products are made of latex-free materials. Our products are manufactured with Neoprene or Koolflex™ material. Neoprene, with insulation of the body’s natural warmth and maintenance of local concentration of heat, aids circulation, resulting in reduction of edema. Neoprene also allows the soft tissue to become more pliable and, therefore, less susceptible to injury. The four-way stretch of neoprene provides more even compression than conventional elastic’s two-way stretch and will maintain its shape, better than most elastic-based products. Koolflex™ is a light, cool breathable knit-spacer fabric which wicks perspiration away from the skin. KoolFlex™ is not a replacement for neoprene. It is offered as an alternative for people who have to wear supports for long periods of time or have heat or allergy issues with neoprene.","809774441","4DCS9","craig@newoptionssports.com","214-638-6422","http://www.newoptionssports.com/","Y"

Terradepth's solution to scaled ocean data collection focuses on three areas of innovation to reduce the reliance on these surface assets: unmatched endurance, in-stride AI-aided Automatic Target Recognition, navigational accuracy and acoustic comms. These innovations are incorporated into a hybrid autonomous surface and underwater vehicle, termed an 'AxV'. Our single variant, dual domain vehicle can operate at the surface and submerged and conducts missions as a collaborative swim-pair. The AxV pairs are designed to carry survey payloads for high-res bathymetry, imagery and water column profiling. The vehicle’s are capable of swapping roles.
